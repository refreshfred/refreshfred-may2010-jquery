jQuery - an introduction and such
----------------------------------------------

These slides and code pertain to the presentation I gave at
Refresh Fred in May of 2010. It's 2AM, and I seriously need sleep,
so I'll update this readme later. Everything in here should be
self explanatory.

Oh, and this only works well in Webkit right now, since it's so CSS3-heavy.
It could be ported to work in other browsers easily; it's MIT licensed, so fork
and do whatever if you want to use the codebase. Enjoy.
